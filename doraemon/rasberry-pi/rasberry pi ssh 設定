Enable SSH
As of the November 2016 release, Raspbian has the SSH server disabled by default. It can be enabled manually from the desktop:

Launch Raspberry Pi Configuration from the Preferences menu
Navigate to the Interfaces tab
Select Enabled next to SSH
Click OK
Alternatively, raspi-config can be used in the terminal:

Enter sudo raspi-config in a terminal window
Select Interfacing Options
Navigate to and select SSH
Choose Yes
Select Ok
Choose Finish
Alternatively, use systemctl to start the service

sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
